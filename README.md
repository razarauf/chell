# chell

The program implements Unix shell commands using C. I have written this C program during my Intro to Operating Systems class to further enhance my knowledge of C and the Unix shell. I modularly implemented commands such as the ability to traverse directories, list folder structure, store and print command history, alias commands, fork processes, and others, over the period of the class.

An extension of this program is in the folder called "extension" which adds the functionality to pipe and redirect data. 

A more detailed description of the program is provided as a PDF called "specifications.pdf".

The execution of the program is provided as logs files.
